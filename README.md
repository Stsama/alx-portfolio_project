Here is the portfolio project that we're asked to come up with during the alx evaluation


# The project name is FeedMe

My project, an online food ordering system serves as a bridge between hungry customers and restaurants, making the process efficient, cost-effective, and mutually beneficial. I worked alone on this project. As an engineering problem, we wanted to focus on 2 things: creating an experience that would be both web-friendly, and also sourcing a reliable and sophisticated API


** Some features:***
- OAuth (login and sign up) via the app
- adding, modifying and deleting a product (for seller)
- possibility to see all the foods, place an order (customer) and see his informations
- possibility for the admin to see all the users, delete a seller,  see all the orders
- The website is responsive and compatible with mobile. This means users can access the project from a mobile view!


# A Small story about this application:
Every human needs and  enjoys eating, so it was an easy project focus to choose. For me, being able to order food wherever you are is something that really is one of the great inventions of the  internet . In past jobs Iâ€™ve had, In the past area where I was, I lived far from any restaurant , so  getting a place in a restaurant was a struggle,  I had to search on about  6km to find a restaurant, this is why it was the first project that comes out of my mind



The API development has involved more than just my writing code; it requires thoughtful consideration of documentation, testing, security, and adoption strategies. By addressing these challenges, I can create robust and user-friendly APIs that enhance the overall my developer experience.
